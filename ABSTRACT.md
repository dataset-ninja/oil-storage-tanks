The author of the **Oil Storage Tanks** dataset recognize the significant role played by oil storage tanks in the global economy. These tanks serve as crucial points for the storage of crude oil throughout various stages, from extraction to eventual sale. Additionally, nations utilize storage tanks to create reserves of oil, and the volume of oil held in these tanks serves as a vital economic indicator. It offers insights into the production trends of oil-producing nations and provides a window into the worldwide demand for energy resources. However, it's essential to note that information related to oil storage is often not transparent, as nations may withhold data concerning oil production, consumption, and storage for various economic or military reasons. To address this issue, companies such as [Planet](https://www.planet.com/) and [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/) have undertaken the task of collecting satellite imagery of oil storage tanks and estimating the volumes of reserves.

The estimation of tank volumes is made feasible due to the prevalent use of *floating head tank* in storing oil. These tanks feature a head that directly rests on top of the crude oil, preventing the accumulation of fumes. Consequently, the height of the tank head fluctuates in correspondence with the volume of oil contained within the tank. Analysts can utilize the relative dimensions of the exterior shadow cast by the tank and the interior shadow created by the height of the tank head to make estimations regarding the tank's volume.

Within this dataset, satellite images sourced from Google Earth depict industrial areas worldwide, specifically those housing oil tanks. These images come with annotations that include bounding box information pinpointing the locations of floating head tanks within the images. Notably, fixed head tanks remain unannotated.

In the *large_images* directory, you will find the original 4800x4800 images directly obtained from Google Earth. These files follow the naming convention <i>id_large.jpg</i>.

The *image_patches* directory contains 512x512 patches extracted from the larger images. Each large image is divided into 100 patches of size 512x512, with an overlap of 37 pixels along both axes. These patches are named <i>id_row_column.jpg</i>.
